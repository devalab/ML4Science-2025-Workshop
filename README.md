# ML4Science 2025 Workshop

This repository contains all the notebooks for the ML4Science 2025 Workshop.

## Notebooks

### Introductory Notebook

The introductory notebook covers Python fundamentals, NumPy, cheminformatics with RDKit, and basic PyTorch concepts. It's designed as pre-work to help you get familiar with the tools and concepts we'll use throughout the workshop.

**Please work through this notebook at your own convenience before the workshop.** Don't worry if certain sections (especially PyTorch and neural networks) feel unclear—we'll cover all these topics in much greater detail during the workshop with additional notebooks and hands-on exercises. You can always revisit this material later as concepts become clearer!
