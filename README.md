# ML4Science 2025 Workshop

This repository contains all the notebooks for the ML4Science 2025 Workshop.

## Getting Started with Google Colab

If you're new to Google Colab, watch this helpful tutorial: [Introduction to Google Colab](https://youtu.be/RLYoEyIHL6A)

### How to Run the Notebooks

1. Download the notebook from this GitHub repository to your local system
2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Upload the notebook: `File → Upload notebook` and select the downloaded file
4. Choose your runtime: `Runtime → Change runtime type` and select CPU or GPU as needed
5. Run the cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter` or run them all together using the commands from the menu.

## Notebooks

### Introductory Notebook

The introductory notebook covers Python fundamentals, NumPy, cheminformatics with RDKit, and basic PyTorch concepts. It's designed as pre-work to help you get familiar with the tools and concepts we'll use throughout the workshop.

**Please work through this notebook at your own convenience before the workshop.** Don't worry if certain sections (especially PyTorch and neural networks) feel unclear—we'll cover all these topics in much greater detail during the workshop with additional notebooks and hands-on exercises. You can always revisit this material later as concepts become clearer!

### Day 2

#### Decision Trees Without Fingerprints

- The Dataset we use for these notebooks is ESol.
- In these notebooks, we will explore decision trees using raw molecular representations instead of traditional fingerprints.
- We will learn to predict properties like LogS and LogP using decision trees.
